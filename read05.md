# Images:
## Adding Images:
## < img>:  To add an image into the page you need to use an < img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
**src:** This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. 

**alt:** This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it. 

**title:** You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.

## Height & Width of Images:
**height:** This specifies the height of the image in pixels. 

**width:** This specifies the width of theimage in pixels.

### Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea to specify the size of the image so that the browser can render the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of space for the image that is still loading.


### Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:

1. before a paragraph: The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
2. inside the start of a paragraph: The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
3. in the middle of a paragraph: The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

## Old Code: Aligning Images Horizontally:
**align:**  The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images:

**left:**
This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).

**right:** 
This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).

## Old Code: Aligning Images Vertically:

**top:**
This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.

**middle:**
This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.

**bottom:**
This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.
