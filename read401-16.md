## Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle?

  - The Web-Request-Response-Cycle: the way information flows through the system.
  - First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.
  
## Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC?
  - A server is a computer on a network that manages network resources. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information
## What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
  - Deploying an application is the process of copying, configuring and enabling a specific application to a specific base URL on Zend Server or on a cluster. 
  - It is make the application run and work in evry where in browser .


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
  - **Server:**
    - A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.
  - **Pub/Sub:**
    - Pub/Sub enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers.
    - Publishers communicate with subscribers asynchronously by broadcasting events, rather than by synchronous remote procedure calls (RPCs)
    
  - **WRRC:**
    - Web-Request-Response-Cycle:The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).


## Virtual Machines:
  - A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps
  - Virtual Machines Maneger : it is type of software that allows us to run an operating system within another operating system.


## VMS and the Cloud:
  - **What is Virtualization:** Virtualization enables users to disjoint operating systems from the underlying hardware, i.e, users can run multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux, on a single physical machine at the same time.
  - **Hypervisor:** A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.
  - **Cloud computing :** is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

## AWS EC2:
  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## Elastic Beanstalk:
  - AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.
  - Elastic Beanstalk is the fastest and simplest way to deploy your application on AWS
  - Elastic Beanstalk provisions and operates the infrastructure and manages the application stack (platform) for you, so you don't have to spend the time or develop the expertise
