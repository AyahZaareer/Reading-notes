  - The Web-Request-Response-Cycle: the way information flows through the system.
  - First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.
## Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC?
## What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
