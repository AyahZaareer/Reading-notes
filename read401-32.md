# Context API - Behaviors


## When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?
  - **function** because If two or more context values are often used together, you might want to consider creating your own render prop component that provides both.
## What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?
  - Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult. If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

## How can you best test context?
  - The best way to test Context is to make our tests unaware of its existence and avoiding mocks.
  -  We want to test our components in the same way that developers would use them (behavioral testing) and mimic the way they would run in our applications (integration testing).



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
  - **context:**
    - React Context is a method to pass props from parent to child component(s), by storing the props in a store(similar in Redux) and using these props from the store by child component(s) without actually passing them manually at each level of the component tree.

  - **useContext()**
    - “useContext” hook is used to create common data that can be accessed throughout the component hierarchy without passing the props down manually to each level. Context defined will be available to all the child components without involving “props”.

  - **static context**
    - which wraps our component with PureComponent shallow comparison logic while also allowing us to pass references from our context


## context api
  - In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
  - Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

## React.createContext:
   - Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

   - The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This default value can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them. Note: passing undefined as a Provider value does not cause consuming components to use defaultValue.

## hooks and context example:
  - React's useContext hook makes it easy to pass data throughout your app without manually passing props down the tree. ... Context can make a nice simple alternative to Redux when your data is simple or your app is small. Most of the React Hooks give function components capabilities they didn't have before.
