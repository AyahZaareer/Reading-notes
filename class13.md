## describe what each group of status code represents:
### 100’s = the request has been recieved from the client and waiting the server to comply .
### 200 =Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
### 300’s =Indicates multiple options for the resource from which the client may choose 
### 400’s =The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client erro
### 500’s =Internal Server Error A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable


## What is a status code 202?
###  Accepted :The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs

## What is a status code 308?
### Permanent Redirect (RFC 7538) :The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. 307 and 308 parallel the behaviors of 302 and 301, but do not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly


## What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
