# Lists:

## Ordered lists: are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
## Unordered lists: are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
## Definition lists :are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.


## The ordered list is created with the < ol> element:

## The unordered list is created with the < ul> element:

## < dl> The definition list is created with the < dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the < dl> element you will usually see pairs of < dt> and < dd> elements. < dt> This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term). < dd> This is used to contain the definition.

## Lists can be nested inside one another:

# Boxes:
## The CSS Box Model: In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

## The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:

## Explanation of the different parts:

1. Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
2. Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
3. Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
4. Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

## Limiting Width (min-width, max-width):
### Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

## Limiting Height (min-height, max-height)
### In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties. 

## Overflowing Content:
### The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
**hidden** : This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.

**scroll**: This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content. On the left, you can see two boxes whose contents expand beyond their set dimensions. The first example has the overflow property with a value of hidden. The second example has the overflow property
