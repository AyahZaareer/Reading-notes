## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development:
- reduce the time required for project development.
- Code flexibility and easier maintenance.
- Less debugging 



## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests, you can use beforeEach and afterEach.




## What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
- **Tests got to be maintained when requirements change :**
Probably, the strongest argument against TDD is that the tests need to be maintained because the code has got to. Whenever requirements change, you would like to vary the code and tests. But you’re working with TDD. this suggests that you simply got to change the tests first then make the tests pass



## What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.


## Why REST?
- REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia and REST is much easier than other approaches

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
- functional programming:
  - In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects.

- object-oriented programming (OOP):
  - Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or         attributes. Each object can also contain its own procedures or methods. Software is designed by using objects that interact with one another. is a programming paradigm         based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code

- **class:**
  - is a blueprint that defines the variables and methoed common to all object of certain kind.


-**super:**
  - The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.


- **this:**
  - The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.this can also be used to:
     - Invoke current class constructor
    - Invoke current class method
    - Return the current class object
    - Pass an argument in the method call
    - Pass an argument in the constructor call


- **Test Driven Development (TDD):**
   - Test-driven development : refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).


- **Jest:**
  - Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-       rich API that gives you results quickly.
  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - The "CI" in CI/CD always refers to continuous integration, which is an automation process for developers. Successful CI means new code changes to an app are regularly          built, tested, and merged to a shared repository. It’s a solution to the problem of having too many branches of an app in development at once that might conflict with each      other.
  
- **REST:**
  -  REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with        each other
  
- **Data Model:**
  -  is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities



## Preparation Materials:
- nosql vs sql:
  |    SQL                                         |                     NoSQL             |
  |------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
  |SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database|
  |SQL databases are table based databases |NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
  |SQL databases have predefined schema|NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data|
  |SQL databases are vertically scalable| NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
  |SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful|In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents|
