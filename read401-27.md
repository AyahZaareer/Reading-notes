# useState() Hook:

## How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
  - With React, we write HTML using JavaScript. We rely on the power of JavaScript to generate HTML that depends on some data, rather than enhancing HTML to make it work with that data. Enhancing HTML is what other JavaScript frameworks usually do.
  - Vanilla JS is nothing but plain JS without any external libraries or frameworks. Using this we can build powerful and cross-platform applications.
  - React is a Javascript library used for building user interfaces. It allows us to make complex UIs from isolated pieces of code called "components".
  - In Vanilla JS, the code becomes very difficult to maintain if the application is large because in such cases the UI needs to be updated regularly.

## What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?
   - A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
  - **Functional Components:**
    - Functional components are basic JavaScript functions. These are typically arrow functions but can also be created with the regular function keyword. Sometimes referred to as “dumb” or “stateless” components as they simply accept data and display them in some form; that is they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.

  - **Children / Child Components:**
     - There is one prop that gets special treatment unlike all the others.  Children allow you to pass components as data to other components, just like any other prop you use.

## What is Hooks?
  - Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React . It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. It does not work inside classes.

## When to use a Hooks:
  - If you write a function component, and then you want to add some state to it, previously you do this by converting it to a class. But, now you can do it by using a Hook inside the existing function component.

## Hooks State:
   - Hook state is the new way of declaring a state in React app. Hook uses useState() functional component for setting and retrieving state. Let us understand Hook state with the following example.

## Hooks Effect:
   - The Effect Hook allows us to perform side effects (an action) in the function components. It does not use components lifecycle methods which are available in class components. In other words, Effects Hooks are equivalent to componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount() lifecycle methods.


## Basic Hooks:
   - **useState:**

       - Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it. During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState). The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component.

   - **Functional updates:**
     - If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a function to setState. The function will receive the previous value, and return an updated value. Here’s an example of a counter component that uses both forms of setState:

   - The ”+” and ”-” buttons use the functional form, because the updated value is based on the previous value. But the “Reset” button uses the normal form, because it always sets the count back to the initial value.
