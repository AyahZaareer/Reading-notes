# Message Queues:

## What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
  - it mean there are two wey connection from client to server and server to client.because the webSocket increases speed and real-time capability on the web. WebSockets also enable servers to keep track of clients and “push” data to them as needed, which was not possible using only HTTP.
## Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
  - a socket.io server will attach to an HTTP server so it can server it is own client code through/socket.io/soccker.io.js 
## What happens when a client emits an event?
  - The event gets passed to the server through websockets. Its a tcp connection from the browser to the server. The connection is full duplex meaning the server can send real time data to the client and vise versa.
## What happens when a server emits an event?
  - All listening client will execute the handeler for that event.
## What happens if a client “misses” an event?
  - the event handler wont run
## How can we mitigate this?

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
 - **Socket:**
   - A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
 - **Web Socket:**
   - WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
 - **Socket.io:**
   - is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. 
 - **Client:**
   -  client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server as part of the client–server model of computer networks
 - **Server:**
   - a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". 
 - **OSI Model:**
   -  Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.
 - **TCP Model:**
   - The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model. It contains four layers, unlike seven layers in the OSI model. The layers are:
   
    1. Process/Application Layer
    2. Host-to-Host/Transport Layer
    3. Internet Layer
    4.  Network Access/Link Layer
   
 - **TCP:**
   - TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.
 - **UDP:**
   - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.

 - **Packets:**
   - packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks*, such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or device that receives them.


## Preview:
 - Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
   - Socket.io
 - Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
   - Socket.io
 - What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
   - Socket.io





## Socket.IO :
   - **Socket.IO is composed of two parts:**
    1. A server that integrates with (or mounts on) the Node.JS HTTP Server socket.io
    2. A client library that loads on the browser side socket.io-client.
    
## Emitting events:
  - The main idea behind Socket.IO is that you can send and receive any events you want, with any data you want. Any objects that can be encoded as JSON will do, and binary data is supported too.


## Broadcasting:
  - The next goal is for us to emit the event from the server to the rest of the users.In order to send an event to everyone, Socket.IO gives us the io.emit() method.
  - If you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket, we have the broadcast flag for emitting from that socket:

## Rooms:
#### A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients:
