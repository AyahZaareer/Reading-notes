# Component Lifecycle:


## Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
   - In the Multipage apps in second hand, we split up our components but a lot of pages are going to be normal HTML pages, and widgets we dump in like an Image gallery that is managed by React, so the entire page is not under React control.
## If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
 - Outside the <BrowserRouter/>
 - Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />
 - Inside a <Route />
## What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
## What does props.children contain?
## How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
