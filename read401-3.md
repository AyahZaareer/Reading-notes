# Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware:
- Error Handling.
- Athenticatin and Authorization.
- Parameters validation.


# True or false: The route handler is middleware?
## false :  Route handler is a peice of code, that's make HTTP methods: Get(), Put(), Post() and Delete().

# In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
## with using next() method.

# At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
## Access to the request object  the answer object and the next function for the meddleware.The The request is applied when the server receives the request.


# What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
## This happens when you have more then one respons being sent to your client.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
## Middleware:
#### Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications. It’s sometimes called plumbing, as it connects two applications together so data and databases can be easily passed between the “pipe.” Using middleware allows users to perform such requests as submitting forms on a web browser, or allowing the web server to return dynamic web pages based on a user’s profile.
#### Common middleware examples include database middleware, application server middleware, message-oriented middleware, web middleware, and transaction-processing monitors. Each program typically provides messaging services so that different applications can communicate using messaging frameworks like simple object access protocol (SOAP), web services, representational state transfer (REST), and JavaScript object notation (JSON). While all middleware performs communication functions, the type a company chooses to use will depend on what service is being used and what type of information needs to be communicated. This can include security authentication, transaction management, message queues, applications servers, web servers, and directories. Middleware can also be used for distributed processing with actions occurring in real time rather than sending data back and forth.

## Request Object:
#### The request object allows you to submit a POST or GET request to an URL. Essentially it provides a way to make REST API requests to another URL.And The request object is the main entry point for an application to issue a request to the Library - all operations on a URL must use a Request object. The request object is application independent in that both servers and clients use the same Request class.

## Response Object:
#### the Response object: It is the object which communicates between the server and the output which is sent to the client. To write an ASP page, all you need to do is write a standard HTML page, putting in the Active Server Pages script where needed . And  by using response object we can control the flow of information , manage buffer, we can redirect visitor to another page, we can control the browser cache and we can end the script execution.

## Application Middleware:
#### a middleware that is bound to an instance of express, using app.use() and app.VERB().

## Routing Middleware:
#### 	a middleware that bound to an instance of express.Router().

## Test Driven Development:
#### Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.

## Behavioral Testing:
#### Behavioural Testing is a testing of the external behaviour of the program, also known as black box testing. It is usually a functional testing.

# ES6 Classes:
## Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
## Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations:
- Class declarations : One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class .
- Class expressions : A class expression is another way to define a class. Class expressions can be named or unnamed. The name given to a named class expression is local to the class's body. (it can be retrieved through the class's (not an instance's) name property, though).

# Use Express Routing:
## Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.You define routing using methods of the Express app object that correspond to HTTP methods; for example, app.get() to handle GET requests and app.post to handle POST requests. For a full list, see app.METHOD. You can also use app.all() to handle all HTTP methods and app.use() to specify middleware as the callback function

# Express Routing:
## Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.
