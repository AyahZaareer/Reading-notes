# Redux - Additional Topics


## What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
  - The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount ) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app
## When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
  - You export the actual action from the reducer


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
  - **middleware:**
     -  Middleware allows for side effects to be run without blocking state updates. We can run side effects (like API requests) in response to a specific action, or in response to every action that is dispatched (like logging).

  - **thunk:**
     - Thunk is a programming concept where a function is used to delay the evaluation/calculation of an operation.
     - Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store’s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function’s body once the asynchronous operations have been completed.



## Redux Toolkit
  -  Redux Toolkit was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:
     - "Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
     - "I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
     - "Redux requires too much boilerplate code"
  - Redux Toolkit also includes a powerful data fetching and caching capability that we've dubbed "RTK Query". It's included in the package as a separate set of entry points. It's optional, but can eliminate the need to hand-write data fetching logic yourself.
  - Redux Toolkit is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic, and we strongly recommend that you use it.
  - It includes several utility functions that simplify the most common Redux use cases, including store setup, defining reducers, immutable update logic, and even creating entire "slices" of state at once without writing any action creators or action types by hand. It also includes the most widely used Redux addons, like Redux Thunk for async logic and Reselect for writing selector functions, so that you can use them right away.
 


## Why You Should Use Redux Toolkit?
  - Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience. It can be added at the start of a new project, or used as part of an incremental migration in an existing project.


## RTK Query
  - RTK Query is provided as an optional addon within the @reduxjs/toolkit package. It is purpose-built to solve the use case of data fetching and caching, supplying a compact, but powerful toolset to define an API interface layer for your app. It is intended to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.
  - RTK Query is built on top of the Redux Toolkit core for its implementation, using Redux internally for its architecture. Although knowledge of Redux and RTK are not required to use RTK Query, you should explore all of the additional global store management capabilities they provide, as well as installing the Redux DevTools browser extension, which works flawlessly with RTK Query to traverse and replay a timeline of your request & cache behavior.
