# Redux - Asynchronous Actions



## How granular should your reducers be?
  - It is difficult to manage states that are deeply nested, so more reducers is better than only a few. Redux gives us combineReducers to let us define more precisely what our initial state will look like.
## Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
   - Con :Dispatching an action within a reducer is an anti-pattern. Your reducer should be without side effects, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects
## Name a strategy for preventing the above
   - Make a reducer for each component that will be affected by the dispatcher, only effecting a specific amount of the state it self.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

   - **Store:**
      - A store is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the application's state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer. Let us see how we can create a store using the createStore method from Redux.

   - **Combined reducers:**
      - The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore . The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object.



## Async actions
   - By default, Redux’s actions are dispatched synchronously, which is a problem for any non-trivial app that needs to communicate with an external API or perform side effects. Redux also allows for middleware that sits between an action being dispatched and the action reaching the reducers
   - There are two very popular middleware libraries that allow for side effects and asynchronous actions: Redux Thunk and Redux Saga.

       - And then we could use that middleware like this:

## Thunk middleware

## Redux thunk
   - Thunk is a programming concept where a function is used to delay the evaluation/calculation of an operation.
   - Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store’s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function’s body once the asynchronous operations have been completed.


## Using Redux Thunk
   - The most common use case for Redux Thunk is for communicating asynchronously with an external API to retrieve or save data. Redux Thunk makes it easy to dispatch actions that follow the lifecycle of a request to an external API.
