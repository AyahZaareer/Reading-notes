# Graphs


## Graphs:
  - A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
  - A Graph in the data structure can be termed as a data structure consisting of data that is stored among many groups of edges(paths) and vertices (nodes), which are interconnected. Graph data structure (N, E) is structured with a collection of Nodes and Edges. Both nodes and vertices need to be finite.٠٧‏/١٠‏/٢٠٢٠
