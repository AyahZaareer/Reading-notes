# Context API


## Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()
  - useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
  - Although useState is a Basic Hook for managing simple state transformation and useReducer is an Additional Hook for managing more complex state logic, it is worth noting that useState uses the useReducer internally. This implies that you could use useReducer for everything you can do with useState.
  - useReducer lets you avoid passing down callbacks through different levels of your component, instead allowing you to pass a provided dispatch function, which in turn will improve performance for components that trigger deep updates.
  - the useState updater function is newly called on each render. What it means is that when you have a complex logic to update state, you simply won’t use the setter directly to update state; instead, you will write a complex function, which in turn would call the setter with updated state.

## Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
  - We can decide what it takes as arguments, and what, if anything, it should return. In other words, it's just like a normal function. Its name should always start with use so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.

## What do custom hooks usually do?
  - Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.٠٧‏/

## Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
  - Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated. How does a custom Hook get isolated state? Each call to a Hook gets isolated state.
## Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
  - Put the fetchData function above in the useEffect hook and call it, like so: 
  useEffect(() => { const url = "https://api.adviceslip.com/advice";
  const fetchData = async () => { try { 
  const response = await fetch(url); 
  const json = await response. json();
  console. log(json); }
  catch (error) { console
  
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
  - **reducer:**
    -  A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application's state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application's state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently


## context api:
   - In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
   - Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component:

   - Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

## React.createContext:
   - Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

   - The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This default value can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them. Note: passing undefined as a Provider value does not cause consuming components to use defaultValue.

## Consuming Multiple Contexts
  - To keep context re-rendering fast, React needs to make each context consumer a separate node in the tree.

## Caveats:
  - Because context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider’s parent re-renders. For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value:

## hooks and context example:
  - After performing an audit on how we communicate with our users, we landed with a simple system of three classes of communication, and snackbars fit perfectly on the ‘low priority’ end of that spectrum. They are small notifications that show up on the screen when a user performs an action. They are not intrusive at all and appear for just a brief moment.
  - **Dream State** : From an engineering standpoint, our snackbar system must easy to use and generally be very lightweight. We want to be able to place one on the screen with just a couple of lines of code. Anything more and it’s overkill.This means forget render props and higher order components. We don’t want to deal with a messy React tree and wrappers. We don’t want action creators, reducers*, or any of that stuff.Hooks are a perfect fit here. So lets imagine we have a custom hook that lets us do this and work backwards.

  - **Globally Accessible**: The state of our snackbars (which ones are visible) can be localized to a single centralized component. That same centralized component can be responsible for rendering them. There’s really no need for another component somewhere in the tree to hook into that state (at least not in our use-case).
However, the management of that state (adding, removing) needs to be globally accessible.
Context can let us do just this.

## Room for Change:
   - There’s a lot of buzz around how you can replace a lot of what Redux does with useContext and useReducer. The combination of these two hooks means we can have a global state and use Redux-like reducers, actions, and dispatchers to mutate that global state. To an extent, it’s possible.
