## Write the following steps in the correct order:
1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party 
3. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
4. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint 
5. Receive authorization code
6. Make a request to the access token endpoint
7. Receive access token


## What can you do with an authorization code?
  - it allows the user to get access  for Token.

## What can you do with an access token?
-  token is generally used to represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created

## Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication? 
- It allows limited access to the user's data and allows accessing when authorization tokens expire. 
- It has ability to share data for users without having to release personal information
- It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
 - **Client ID:**
   - Client ID is a unique eight-digit number generated by the depository participants to easily identify their clients.
   
 - **Client Secret:**
   - A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors.
  
 - **Authentication Endpoint:**
    - Endpoint authentication is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service. 
    
 - **Access Token Endpoint:**
    - The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. This section describes how to verify token requests and how to return the appropriate response and errors.

 - **API Endpoint:**
    -  is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function
    
 - **Authorization Code:**
    - An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.

 - **Access Token:**
   -  The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.
