## Write the following steps in the correct order:
1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party 
3. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
4. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint 
5. Receive authorization code
6. Make a request to the access token endpoint
7. Receive access token


## What can you do with an authorization code?
  - it allows the user to get access  for Token.

## What can you do with an access token?
-  token is generally used to represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created

## Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication? 
- It allows limited access to the user's data and allows accessing when authorization tokens expire. 
- It has ability to share data for users without having to release personal information
- It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
 - **Client ID:**
   - Client ID is a unique eight-digit number generated by the depository participants to easily identify their clients.
   
 - **Client Secret:**
   - A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors.
  
 - **Authentication Endpoint:**
    - Endpoint authentication is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service. 
    
 - **Access Token Endpoint:**
    - The token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. This section describes how to verify token requests and how to return the appropriate response and errors.

 - **API Endpoint:**
    -  is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function
    
 - **Authorization Code:**
    - An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.

 - **Access Token:**
   -  The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.



## Intro to JWT(JSON Web Tokens):
 - **What is JSON Web Token?**
  - JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
  - JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

 - **When should you use JSON Web Tokens?**
  1. **Authorization:**
   -  This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
  2. **Information Exchange:**
   - JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. 

 - **What is the JSON Web Token structure?**
  - JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:
   - Header
    -The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

   - Payload:
    - The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data

   - Signature:
    - To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
