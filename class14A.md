## What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

### In the mid-80s the number of women in computer science began to drop. Some argue this is because of the rise of the personal computer and its strong association with boys.Male computer science graduates highly outnumber female computer science graduates in the US. This pattern is repeated in Europe too.Less women entering computer science education means less female technologists entering the workforce.Less that 1/3 of software developers in the US are women.
Once women enter technology careers the quit rate (41%) is higher than for men (17%)
