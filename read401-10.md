# Stacks and Queues:

## What is a Stack:
 - A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
 - A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top.

### Common terminology for a stack :
 - **Push** : Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.
 - **Pop** : Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
