# Stacks and Queues:

## What is a Stack:
 - A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
 - A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top.

### Common terminology for a stack :
 - **Push** : Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.
 - **Pop** : Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
 - **Top**: This is the top of the stack.
 - **Peek**: When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
 - **IsEmpty**:  returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

- **Stacks follow these concepts:**
  - FILO(First In Last Out) : This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
  - LIFO(Last In First Out) : This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.
