# Layout:

## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements:

### Building Blocks: CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box. Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.

### Containing Elements: If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element. It is common to group a number of elements together inside a < div> (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation). The < div> element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.
