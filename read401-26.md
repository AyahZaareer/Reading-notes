# Component Based UI:


## Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)?
  - Angular
  - Vue.js
  - jQuery
  - Backbone.js
  - Polymer
## What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
  - A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.
  - A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by subclassing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework's code then calls your code at these points.


## Document the ollowing Vocabulary Terms:
   - **Rendering:**
      - Rendering is a process that is triggered by a change of state in some component of your application, when a state change occurs React: It will collect from the root of your App all the components that requested a re-render because their state or their props changed.

   - **Templates:**
      - React templates are sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces. React templates may contain full-fledged pages with a pre-built design, component compositions, stand-alone components, styling (like fonts, colors theme effects, background styles, icons), plugins, widgets, libraries
   - **State:**
      - What is State? The state is an instance of React Component Class can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.


## What Is React?
  - React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

## what is JSX?
  - JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

## Rendering Elements:
  - **Rendering an Element into the DOM:**

       - Let’s say there is a < div> somewhere in your HTML file,We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM. Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.
       - To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():

  - **Updating the Rendered Element:**
    - React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.
    - With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

     - It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.

  - **React Only Updates What’s Necessary:**
    - React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
