##  five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
|    SQL        |     NoSQL    |
|---------------|--------------|
|SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database|
|SQL databases are table based databases |NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|SQL databases have predefined schema|NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|SQL databases are vertically scalable| NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
|SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful|In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents|


## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
### SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries.

## SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.
## NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
### NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
### For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
