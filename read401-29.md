#  Advanced State with Reducers

## How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?
  - Just add an empty array after the callback function separated by a comma useEffect(callback, []);
## Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?
  - You can only pass one argument to useState(), but you can have multiple useState() invocations as you'll see outlined further in the reading.
## Is useState() synchronous?
  - useState and setState both are asynchronous. They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

  - **State Hook:**
    - The state is an instance of React Component can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
  - **Component Lifecycle:**
    - Every React Component has a lifecycle of its own, lifecycle of a component can be defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the component's existence. Mounting: Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself.


## useReducer hook:

  - useReducer is one of the additional Hooks that shipped with React 16.8. An alternative to the useState Hook, it helps you manage complex state logic in React applications. When combined with other Hooks like useContext, useReducer can be a good alternative to Redux or MobX — indeed, it can sometimes be an outright better option.

  - An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If you’re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)

  - useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
  - There are two different ways to initialize useReducer state. You may choose either one depending on the use case. The simplest way is to pass the initial state as a second argument:

## How does useReducer work?

  - useReducer is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.
  - useReducer returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function, to which you can pass an action and later invoke. This is similar to the pattern Redux uses but with a few differences.
  - useReducer can accept a third parameter, which is an optional init function for creating the initial state lazily. It lets you extract logic for calculating the initial state outside of the reducer function, as you can see below:

  - **The dispatch method** The dispatch function accepts an object that represents the type of action we want to execute when it is called. It basically sends the type of action to the reducer function to perform its job, which, of course, is updating the state.
