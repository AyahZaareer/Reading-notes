#  Advanced State with Reducers

## How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?
  - Just add an empty array after the callback function separated by a comma useEffect(callback, []);
## Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?
  - You can only pass one argument to useState(), but you can have multiple useState() invocations as you'll see outlined further in the reading.
## Is useState() synchronous?
  - useState and setState both are asynchronous. They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object.
