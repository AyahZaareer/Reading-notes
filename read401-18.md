# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda:


## What are serverless functions?
  - A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.

  
## If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
  - Log in to your AWS Account, and navigate to the Lambda console. Click on Create function. We'll be creating a Lambda from scratch, so select the Author from scratch option. Enter an appropriate name for your Lambda function, select a Python runtime and define a role for your Lambda to use
## Describe how a CDN works
  - To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website’s server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.
  - In essence, CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to your users. For example, when someone in London accesses your US-hosted website, it is done through a local UK PoP. This is much quicker than having the visitor’s requests, and your responses, travel the full width of the Atlantic and back.

   - **Cloud Storage:**
     - Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service. It's delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing your own data storage infrastructure
   - **CDN:** 
     - A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.
