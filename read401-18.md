# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda:


## What are serverless functions?
  - A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.

  
## If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
  - Log in to your AWS Account, and navigate to the Lambda console. Click on Create function. We'll be creating a Lambda from scratch, so select the Author from scratch option. Enter an appropriate name for your Lambda function, select a Python runtime and define a role for your Lambda to use
## Describe how a CDN works
  - To minimize the distance between the visitors and your website’s server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations (a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs). Each PoP contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.
  - In essence, CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to your users. For example, when someone in London accesses your US-hosted website, it is done through a local UK PoP. This is much quicker than having the visitor’s requests, and your responses, travel the full width of the Atlantic and back.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
   - **Serverless Functions:** 
     - A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier.
   - **Cloud Storage:**
     - Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that stores data on the Internet through a cloud computing provider who manages and operates data storage as a service. It's delivered on demand with just-in-time capacity and costs, and eliminates buying and managing your own data storage infrastructure
   - **CDN:** 
     - A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.


## What is Amazon API Gateway?
   - Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

## How does API Gateway work?
   - API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your API’s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services. It can also generate API references from your definitions and make them available to your users as API documentation.

   - API Gateway integrates with many other AWS services like AWS Lambda, AWS SNS, AWS IAM, and Cognito Identity Pools. These integrations allow for fully managed authentication and authorization layers, as well as detailed metrics and tracing for API requests.

## Benefits:
  - Efficient API development
  - Performance at any scale
  - Cost savings at scale
  - Easy monitoring
  - Flexible security controls
  - RESTful API options

## What is DynamoDB?
  - Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.
  - DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:
    - reliable performance even as it scales;
    - a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
    - a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.


## DynamoDB is a particularly good fit for the following use cases:

   - Applications with large amounts of data and strict latency requirements. As your amount of data scales, JOINs and advanced SQL operations can slow down your queries. With DynamoDB, your queries have predictable latency up to any size, including over 100 TBs!

   - Serverless applications using AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda provides auto-scaling, stateless, ephemeral compute in response to event triggers. DynamoDB is accessible via an HTTP API and performs authentication & authorization via IAM roles, making it a perfect fit for building Serverless applications.

   - Data sets with simple, known access patterns. If you're generating recommendations and serving them to users, DynamoDB's simple key-value access patterns make it a fast, reliable choice.

## Dynamoose:
   - Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.
   - To install Dynamoose you can run the following command.
      - npm install --save dynamoose
