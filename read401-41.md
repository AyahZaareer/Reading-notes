## Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
  - The Redux Toolkit generates the new state from the direct changes to the old state. ... The reducers that are written with immer are 2 to 3 times slower than a normal Redux reducer
  - Ducks is a modular pattern that collocates actions, action types and reducers.

  - According to the Ducks proposal:

     - A module…

     - MUST export default a function called reducer()

     - MUST export its action creators as functions

     - MUST have action types in the form npm-module-or-app/reducer/ACTION_TYPE

     - MAY export its action types as UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, if an external reducer needs to listen for them, or if it is a published reusable library


## What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
  - Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
   - **redux toolkit slices:**
     - A Redux Slice is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature of our app. The name “slice” comes from the idea that we're splitting up the root Redux state object into multiple “slices” of slate. ... submissions, and state. topics are each a separate slice of the Redux state.
   - **namespace:**
     - A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries


## React Native 
     - React Native(also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.
     - While Reactjs is basically a JavaScript library and React Native is the entire framework, the former is the heart of the latter, and compliments each other. If Reactjs is optimal for creating apps with high functionality and complex calculations, then React Native is ideal to give a native feeling to your mobile apps

  - The above is a Snack Player. It’s a handy tool created by Expo to embed and run React Native projects and share how they render in platforms like Android and iOS. The code is live and editable, so you can play directly with it in your browser. Go ahead and try changing the "Try editing me!" text above to "Hello, world!"
  - The Text component allows us to render a text, while the View component renders a container. This container has several styles applied, let's analyze what each one is doing.


## What's the difference between state and props in React?
  - In a React component, the props are the variables that we pass from a parent component to a child component. Similarly, the state are also variables, with the difference that they are not passed as parameters, but rather that the component initializes and manages them internally.

   - As shown above, there is no difference in handling the state between React and React Native. You can use the state of your components both in classes and in functional components using hooks!
