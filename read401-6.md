## Explain what a Singleton?
  - A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself. It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation of a class to only one object.
  - The singleton pattern is used in programming languages such as Java and .NET to define a global variable. A single object used across systems remains constant and needs to be defined only once rather than many times.

### Accessing the Instance:
- Whether we’re using a class or a function, any time we call new Singleton() , we’ll be referring to the same instance. But this could easily become confusing: it’s not the expected behaviour for the new keyword.

  - Once we’ve created an instance with **new Singleton()** , we can then call **Singleton.getInstance()** .

### The Argument For:
  - In JavaScript, there’s one main technical advantage for singleton: lazy-loading. Unlike global variables, our singleton will be instantiated only when we first need it.
