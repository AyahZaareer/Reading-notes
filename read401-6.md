## Explain what a Singleton?
  - A singleton is a class that allows only a single instance of itself to be created and gives access to that created instance. It contains static variables that can accommodate unique and private instances of itself. It is used in scenarios when a user wants to restrict instantiation of a class to only one object.
  - The singleton pattern is used in programming languages such as Java and .NET to define a global variable. A single object used across systems remains constant and needs to be defined only once rather than many times.

### Accessing the Instance:
- Whether we’re using a class or a function, any time we call new Singleton() , we’ll be referring to the same instance. But this could easily become confusing: it’s not the expected behaviour for the new keyword.

  - Once we’ve created an instance with **new Singleton()** , we can then call **Singleton.getInstance()** .

### The Argument For:
  - In JavaScript, there’s one main technical advantage for singleton: lazy-loading. Unlike global variables, our singleton will be instantiated only when we first need it.


## Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes:



## If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- Application middleware.
- Auth middleware.



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
 - Router Middleware:
   -Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router().
 - Dynamic Module Loading:
   - Dynamic loading is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from memory. ...

 - Singleton Pattern:
   - the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance
 - CRUD -> REST Method Matches:Craete-Read-Update-Delete
   -
 - Mock Testing:
   - Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviour of the real ones. ... Such a service can be replaced with a mock object.



### Hash Functions:
  - A hash function is a function that takes a set of inputs of any arbitrary size and fits them into a table or other data structure that contains fixed-size elements
  - Hash functions have infinite input length and a predefined output length, so there is inevitably going to be the possibility of two different inputs that produce the same output hash.

## Basic Auth:
 - Basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request.
 - HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it does not require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header.

## OWASP auth cheatsheet:
  - **Authentication :**  is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.
  - **Session Management:** is a process by which a server maintains the state of an entity interacting with it. This is required for a server to remember how to react to subsequent requests throughout a transaction. Sessions are maintained on the server by a session identifier which can be passed back and forward between the client and server when transmitting and receiving requests.
  
## bcrypt docs:
  - bcrypt is a password-hashing function designed .
  - The bcrypt hashing function allows us to build a password security platform that scales with computation power and always hashes every password with a salt.
  - **b** for Blowfish and **crypt** for the name of the hashing function used by the UNIX password system.
