# State and Lifecycle:
## React.Component:
### React lets you define components as classes or functions. Components defined as classes currently provide more features which are described in detail on this page. To define a React component class, you need to extend React.Component:

### The only method you must define in a React.Component subclass is called render(). All the other methods described on this page are optional.

## The Component Lifecycle:
### Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this lifecycle diagram as a cheat sheet. In the list below, commonly used lifecycle methods are marked as bold. The rest of them exist for relatively rare use cases.

#### Mounting
#### These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

.**constructor()**

**static getDerivedStateFromProps()**

**render()**

**componentDidMount()**
