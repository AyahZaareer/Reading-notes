# SQL(Structured Query Language)

## What is SQL?
 SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
 
 - SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)
 - SQL databases are table based databases
 - SQL databases have predefined schema 
 - SQL databases are vertically scalable
 - SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. 
 - SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.
 - SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
 - For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc
 - For high transactional based application: SQL databases are best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, as it is more stable and promises the atomicity as well as integrity of the data. 
 - For DB types: On a high-level, we can classify SQL databases as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors
 
### Relational databases:
 A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.
 
- To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write **SELECT**.

- To filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query
