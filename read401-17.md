#  AWS: S3 and Lambda:


## Describe “The Cloud”
  - The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer. Most cloud services can be accessed through a Web browser like Firefox or Google Chrome, and some companies offer dedicated mobile apps.

## What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
  - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## What is auto-scaling?
  - AWS Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand. You can optimize availability, costs, or a balance of both. AWS Auto Scaling automatically creates all of the scaling policies and sets targets for you based on your preference
## What is bandwidth?
  - Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps)
## How do cloud providers compute service costs?
  - When setting price, cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
  - **Server Instances:**
    - A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based.

  - **Containers:**
  - **Cloud Services:**
    - Cloud services are services available via a remote cloud computing server rather than an on-site server. These scalable solutions are managed by a third party and provide users with access to computing services such as analytics or networking via the internet.
  - **Cloud Architecture:**
    - Cloud architecture is the way technology components combine to build a cloud, in which resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network.
  - **AWS:**
    - Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. 
  - **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:**
    - **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is an Infrastructure as a Service product, and is Amazon’s flagship offering. Before we’re able to deploy an application on Elastic Compute Cloud, we have to develop server infrastructure that will suit our application.
    -  **Heroku** is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) product based on AWS


## What is Amazon S3?
  - Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. It’s a simple storage service that offers industry leading durability, availability, performance, security, and virtually unlimited scalability at very low costs.


##  What can I do with Amazon S3?
  - Amazon S3 provides a simple web service interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere. Using this service, you can easily build applications that make use of cloud native storage. Since Amazon S3 is highly scalable and you only pay for what you use, you can start small and grow your application as you wish, with no compromise on performance or reliability.
  
## What kind of data can I store in Amazon S3?
  - You can store virtually any kind of data in any format


## AWS Lambda Basics:
  - AWS Lambda is one of the most popular serverless computing services out there. It is also the most popular provider used with the Serverless Framework.
  - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.


## How does AWS Lambda work?
  - Each Lambda function runs in its own container. When a function is created, Lambda packages it into a new container and then executes that container on a multi-tenant cluster of machines managed by AWS. Before the functions start running, each function’s container is allocated its necessary RAM and CPU capacity. Once the functions finish running, the RAM allocated at the beginning is multiplied by the amount of time the function spent running. The customers then get charged based on the allocated memory and the amount of run time the function took to complete.


## Supported languages and runtimes:
  - As of now, AWS Lambda doesn’t support all programming languages, but it does support a number of the most popular languages and runtimes. This is the full list of what’s supported:

1.Node.js 8.10
2.Node.js 10.x (normally the latest LTS version from the 10.x series)
3.Node.js 12.x (normally the latest LTS version from the 12.x series)
4.Python 2.7
