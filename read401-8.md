## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
  - **Basic Authorization:** SigiIn/SignUp
  - **Bearer Authorization:** A Bearer Token is set in the Authorization header of every Inline Action HTTP Request.

## What does the JSON Web Token package do?
   - Create token whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource


## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
  - Not to be simple and easy to guess.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
  - **encryption:** Encryption is a means of securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or "key" used to decrypt the information.
  - **token:** A token is an object that can be used to authenticate a user to a server
  - **bearer:** 
  - **secret:** The secret is a symmetric key that is known by both the sender and the receiver. It is negotiated and distributed out of band.And is combined with the header and the payload to create a unique hash. You are only able to verify this hash if you have the secret key.
  - **JSON Web Token:** JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object

 - **Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
 - Token ,Bearer Authorization
 - **Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
 - **What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**
 - I'm excited to see how encoding for the password is done and also to see the full picture of how the app works



## RBAC :
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.Ÿêand the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization.
- When using RBAC, you analyze the needs of your users and group them into roles based on common responsibilities.You then assign one or more roles to each user and one or more permissions to each role. The user-role and role-permissions relationships make it simple to perform user assignments since users no longer need to be managed individually, but instead have privileges that conform to the permissions assigned to their role(s).
 
## 5 steps to RBAC:
1. **Inventory your systems**: Figure out what resources you have for which you need to control access, if you don't already have them listed. Examples would include an email system, customer database, contact management system, major folders on a file server, etc. 
2. **Analyze your workforce and create roles**: You need to group your workforce members into roles with common access needs.  Avoid the temptation to have too many roles defined. Keep them as simple and stratified as possible.
3. **Assign people to roles**: Now that you have a list of roles and their access rights, figure out which role(s) each employee belongs in, and set their access accordingly. 
4. **Never make one-off changes**: Resist any temptation to make a one-off change for an employee with unusual needs. If you begin doing this, your RBAC system will quickly begin to unravel. Change the roles as required or add new ones when really necessary. 
5. **Audit**: Periodically review your roles, the employees assigned to them, and the access permitted for each. If you discover, for example, that a role has unnecessary access to a particular system, change the role and adjust the access level for all employees in that role.
