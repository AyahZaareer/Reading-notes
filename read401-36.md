# Application State with Redux


## What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
  - cookies can store only a much smaller amount of information; the capacity for cookies is 4 Kb for most browsers while local storage and session storage can hold 10 Mb and 5 Mb respectively. This means that cookies are going to be much smaller than local storage and session storage but that's okay for their use cases.

## Explain 3rd party cookies.
  - A third-party cookie is a cookie that is placed on a user's hard disk by a website from a domain other than the one a user is visiting.
  - Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites they visited.
  - For example, a user visits a website called news.com. Cookies placed on this domain by news.com are first-party cookies. A cookie placed by any other site, such as an advertiser or social media site, is a third-party cookie.

## How do pixel tags work?
  - A pixel tag is just that – an element on the page and all of the attributes relating to that pixel. To that end, sometimes the word tags and pixels are used interchangeably. A pixel is always going to be a tag, but a tag isn't always going to be a pixel
  - A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. ... The tracking pixel URL is the memory location on the server. When the user visits a website, the image with the tag is loaded from this server.
  - How Do Tracking Pixels Work? You add the tracking pixel using a code in your site's HTML code or email, which contains an external link to the pixel server. When someone visits your website, the HTML code is processed by their browser, which follows the link and opens the hidden graphic


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
  - **cookies:**
     -  cookies  are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user's computer or other device by the user’s web browser. Cookies are placed on the device used to access a website, and more than one cookie may be placed on a user’s device during a session.
  - **authorization:**
     - Authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is to define an access policy.

  - **access control:**
     - Access control is a fundamental component of data security that dictates who's allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data.

  - **conditional rendering:** 
     - Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition. This concept is applied often in the following scenarios: Rendering external data from an API.


## Fundamentals of Redux :
### what is Redux
  - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. ... You can use Redux together with React, or with any other view library.

### Why Use React Redux?
  - Redux itself is a standalone library that can be used with any UI layer or framework, including React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and vanilla JS. Although Redux and React are commonly used together, they are independent of each other.

  - If you are using Redux with any kind of UI framework, you will normally use a "UI binding" library to tie Redux together with your UI framework, rather than directly interacting with the store from your UI code.


  - Redux allows you to manage your app’s state in a single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable. It makes it easier to reason about changes occurring in your app. But all of these benefits come with tradeoffs and constraints. One might feel it adds up boilerplate code, making simple things a little overwhelming; but that depends upon the architecture decisions.


### What is state management in Redux?
  - State management is essentially a way to facilitate communication and sharing of data across components. It creates a tangible data structure to represent the state of your app that you can read from and write to. That way, you can see otherwise invisible states while you’re working with them.


### How Redux works
  - The way Redux works is simple. There is a central store that holds the entire state of the application. Each component can access the stored state without having to send down props from one component to another.
