# Images:

### Controlling sizes of images in CSS: You can control the size of an  image using the width and  height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.  Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly  because the HTML and CSS  code will often load before the  images, and telling the browser  how much space to leave for an  image allows it to render the rest  of the page without waiting for  the image to download.

## AligNing images Using CSS:

#### :1- The float property is added  to the class that was created to  represent the size of the image  (such as the small class in our  example).
#### 2: New classes are created with  names such as align-left or  align-right to align the images  to the left or right of the page.  These class names are used in  addition to classes that indicate  the size of the image.
