# Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD:
## TDD: 
### Test-driven development reverses traditional development and testing. So, instead of writing your code first and then retroactively fitting a test to validate the piece of code you just wrote, test-driven development dictates that you write the test first and then implement code changes until your code passes the test you already wrote.

## CI/CD:
### Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).Continuous integration is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to implement small changes and check in code to version control repositories frequently. Because most modern applications require developing code in different platforms and tools, the team needs a mechanism to integrate and validate its changes.

## Node Ecosystem:
### Npm (Node Package Manager) is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.  It consists of a command-line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages called the npm registry.

# Array.map():
## The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.And .map() will always return you a new array of the same length as the original array comprised of your return values.

# Array.reduce():
## .reduce() iterates over an array and returns the last version of the “accumulator” … in each iteration, based on the value and/or idx of the current element in the array, you have the opportunity to modify and return the accumulator. After the last iteration of the array, that accumulator value is returned to the caller. initialvalue represents the value of the accumulator in the first iteration.

#  SuperAgent:
## SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!
## Promises are one way to manage Asynchronous actions. Like a callback, a promise allows you to execute some code and “move on”, allowing for that code to take as long as it needs to run. Unlike a callback, the syntax of a promise feels and reads a bit more “inline”

### With normal Promise .then() syntax:

###  with async / await syntax:Async functions can contain zero or more await expressions. Await expressions make promise-returning functions behave as though they're synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression. Use of async and await enables the use of ordinary try / catch blocks around asynchronous code.

# Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous?
## Simply taking a callback doesn't make a function asynchronous. There are many examples of functions that take a function argument but are not asynchronous. ... It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item.
## The callback will be synchronous when the higher order function which calls it is calling it synchronously. Inversely if it is called within the context of the execution branch of an asynchronous operation it will be asynchronous.
