# Event Driven Architecture:


 ## Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
   - Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.

 ## How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
 ## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
 ## How do you test an event driven system?
