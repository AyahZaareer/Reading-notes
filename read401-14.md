 ## Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
   - Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.
## How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
   - by expecting recive an emmited.
## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
  - Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.
## How do you test an event driven system?
  - by creating an automation process that scaffolds up the unit testing environment.
