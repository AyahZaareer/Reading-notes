# Event Driven Architecture:


 ## Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
   - Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.
## How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
   - by expecting recive an emmited.
## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
  - Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.
## How do you test an event driven system?
  - by creating an automation process that scaffolds up the unit testing environment.
 
 
 
 ## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
 - **FIFO Queue:**
   - FIFO ( first in, first out) is a method for organising the manipulation of a data structure (often, specifically a data buffer) where the oldest (first) entry, or "head" of the queue, is processed first.
 - **Pub/Sub:**
   - is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic.
