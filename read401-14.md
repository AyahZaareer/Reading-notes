# Event Driven Architecture:


 ## What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
   - Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.
## How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
   - by expecting recive an emmited.
## What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
  - Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input.
## How do you test an event driven system?
  - by creating an automation process that scaffolds up the unit testing environment.
 
 
 
 ## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
 - **FIFO Queue:**
   - FIFO ( first in, first out) is a method for organising the manipulation of a data structure (often, specifically a data buffer) where the oldest (first) entry, or "head" of the queue, is processed first.
 - **Pub/Sub:**
   - is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic. 


## Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
  - Socket.io
## Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  - Socket.io
## What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
  - Socket.io


## AWS SNS and SQS:
### Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon SNS are both messaging services within AWS, which provide different benefits for developers. Amazon SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a “push” mechanism, eliminating the need to periodically check or “poll” for updates.

### What is Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)?
 - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and send notifications from the cloud. It provides developers with a highly scalable, flexible, and cost-effective capability to publish messages from an application and immediately deliver them to subscribers or other applications. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon SNS follows the “publish-subscribe” (pub-sub) messaging paradigm, with notifications being delivered to clients using a “push” mechanism that eliminates the need to periodically check or “poll” for new information and updates. With simple APIs requiring minimal up-front development effort, no maintenance or management overhead and pay-as-you-go pricing, Amazon SNS gives developers an easy mechanism to incorporate a powerful notification system with their applications.

### What are the benefits of using Amazon SNS?
 - Instantaneous, push-based delivery (no polling)
 - Simple APIs and easy integration with applications
 - Flexible message delivery over multiple transport protocols
 - Inexpensive, pay-as-you-go model with no up-front costs
 - Web-based AWS Management Console offers the simplicity of a point-and-click interface

### How is Amazon SNS different from Amazon SQS?
 - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and Amazon SNS are both messaging services within AWS, which provide different benefits for developers. Amazon SNS allows applications to send time-critical messages to multiple subscribers through a “push” mechanism, eliminating the need to periodically check or “poll” for updates. Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange messages through a polling model, and can be used to decouple sending and receiving components. Amazon SQS provides flexibility for distributed components of applications to send and receive messages without requiring each component to be concurrently available.
