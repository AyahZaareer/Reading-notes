## Ethics in the workplace
### [The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)
  - As developers, we are often one of the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices." This quote really stood out to me, and I haven't necessarily thought of it that way before, that we are one of the last passes through before something gets put out into the world.
  - "Take a stand and ensure that our ethics are ever present in our code." This was another piece of the article that stood out to me, keeping aware and making sure that we're always considering what's at play. That we don't just write lines of code as prescribed, but that we think at a high level what they are doing.
