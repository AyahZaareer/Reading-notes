# AWS: Events

## Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server
   - Amazon’s API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
   - With a few clicks you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application. Amazon API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.
   - Express Gateway is an API Gateway that can sit at the heart of any microservices architecture, regardless of what language or platform you’re using. Express Gateway secures your microservices and exposes them through APIs using Node.js, ExpressJS and Express middleware.

## What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
   - Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it.

## How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
   - The message is stored on the queue until another component called a consumer retrieves the message and does something with it.
   - The client (usually a browser) opens a connection to the server and sends a request. The server processes the request, generates a response, and closes the connection if it finds a Connection: Close header.  Headers may provide various information about the request or the client body data.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
  - **Serverless API:**
     -  is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. 
  - **Triggers:**
     -  A trigger is a stored procedure in database which automatically invokes whenever a special event in the database occurs. For example, a trigger can be invoked when a row is inserted into a specified table or when certain table columns are being updated
  - **Dynamo vs Mongo:**
     - DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas.  
     - DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents.
     - DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.

  - **Dynamoose vs Mongoos:**
     - Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.


## SQS and SNS Basics
   - Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distributed applications to exchange messages through a polling model, and can be used to decouple sending and receiving components.
   - SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe system. Messages are pushed to subscribers as and when they are sent by publishers to SNS


## AWS SQS vs SNS
   - SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe system. Messages are pushed to subscribers as and when they are sent by publishers to SNS. SQS is distributed queuing system. Messages are not pushed to receivers. Receivers have to poll or pull messages from SQS.
   - SQS is mainly used to decouple applications or integrate applications. Messages can be stored in SQS for a short duration of time (maximum 14 days).
   - SNS distributes several copies of messages to several subscribers. For example, let’s say you want to replicate data generated by an application to several storage systems. You could use SNS and send this data to multiple subscribers, each replicating the messages it receives to different storage systems (S3, hard disk on your host, database, etc.).
