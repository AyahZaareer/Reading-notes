# Event Driven Applications:

## Why is access control important?
- The purpose of an access control system is to provide quick, convenient access to those persons who are authorized, while at the same time, restricting access to unauthorized people.


## Describe an application that would need access control.

## What is a role used for?
-  roles are created for various job functions. 

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- Access control systems provide much more than just allowing authorized people to access your building. They are an effective door security solution that enables you to track access as well as manage permissions.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
- **Authorization :** 
  - Authorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features
  
- **Role Based Access Control :**
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security paradigm whereby users are granted access to resources based on their role in the company.

- **Capabilities :** 
  - A capability is a token, ticket, or key that gives the possessor permission to access an entity or object in a computer system.


## Preview:
- **Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
  - SQL.
  - Auth0.
- **Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
  - Event
- **What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**


## Event Driven Programming:
- Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision.
- An event-driven programming approach uses events to trigger various functions. An event can be anything, such as typing a key or clicking a mouse button. A call-back function is already registered with the element executes whenever an event is triggered.


### Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:
 - An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
 - A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.


### What is an EventEmitter in Node.js?
 - EventEmitter is a module that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away
 - EventEmitter is a class that holds all the objects that can emit events
 - Whenever an object from the EventEmitter class throws an event, all attached functions are called upon synchronously

### Removing Listeners:
  To remove event listeners in EventEmitter we can use the removeListener or removeAllListeners method. It’s important to note that in the EventEmitter that comes built-in with Node you must pass a reference to the exact function you wish to remove when using the removeListener method. This means wherever you wish to remove the event, you’ll need to make sure the function is able to be referenced from that place in your code.
  
  
### Object Oriented Programming + Event-Driven Programming:
  - The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit. Using this approach, applications are built with many different units that all speak to and interact with each other.
