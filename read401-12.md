# Socket.io :

## What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
 - to send data reliably and efficintly so data does not have to be sent as a single, large file. 
## UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
 - Connectionless protocols are usually described as stateless because the endpoints have no protocol-defined way to remember where they are in a "conversation" of message exchanges. 
## Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
 - Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.
## Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
 - No. A port of a client can be used by a single connection. 
## Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
 - Yes.we can


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
 - **Observer Pattern:**
  - 
 - **Listener:**
  - function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur.
 - **Event Handler:**
  - is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event
 - **Event Driven Programming:**
  -  An event-driven programming approach uses events to trigger various functions. An event can be anything, such as typing a key or clicking a mouse button. A call-back function is already registered with the element executes whenever an event is triggered.
 - **Event Loop:**
  - Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.
 - **Event Queue:**
  - An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system.
 - **Call Stack:**
  - A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

 - **Emit/Raise/Trigger:**
   
 - **Subscribe:**
  - Subscribes an event handler method or procedure to an ABL or .NET class event.
 - **database:**
  - A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).
  
  
## Preview:
 - **Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**
  - Event
 - **Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**
  - Socket.io 
 - **What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**
  - Socket.io 


## WebSocket:
- WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
- WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4.
- The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the serve
- WebSocket is the communication Protocol that provides bidirectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection; WebSocket remains open all the time, so they allow real-time data transfer. When clients trigger the request to the server, it does not close the connection on receiving the response; it rather persists and waits for the Client or server to terminate the request.


## Socket.io vs Web Sockets:
 - **Socket.IO**:  is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface. Generally, it is divided into two parts; both WebSocket vs Socket.io are event-driven libraries.
