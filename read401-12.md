# Socket.io :

## What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
 - to send data reliably and efficintly so data does not have to be sent as a single, large file. 
## UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
 - Connectionless protocols are usually described as stateless because the endpoints have no protocol-defined way to remember where they are in a "conversation" of message exchanges. 
## Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
 - Multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side IP/Port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side IP/Port pairs, and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to.
## Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
## Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
