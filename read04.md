## Writing Links:
## Links are created using the < a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening < a> tag and the closing < /a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Linking to Other Pages on the Sa me Site:
## When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.

## Directory Structure:
## On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

## Relative URLs:
## Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
