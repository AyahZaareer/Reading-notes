# Links:
## Writing Links:
## Links are created using the < a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening < a> tag and the closing < /a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## Linking to Other Pages on the Sa me Site:
## When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value of the href attribute is just the name of the file.

## Directory Structure:
## On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

## Relative URLs:
## Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

## Email Links:
**mailto:**  To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.

## Opening Links in a New Window:
## If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening < a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.

# Layout:
## Key Concepts in Positioning El ements:
## Building Blocks :CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.


**Containing Elements:** If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element. It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div> (or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and the main navigation). The <div> element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.
  
  ## Normal Flow:
  **position:static:**  In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be:
**position: static;**
I have not specified a width property for the heading element, so you can see how it stretches the width of the entire browser window by default.

## Relative Positioning:
**position:relative:** Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. For example, you can move it 10 pixels lower than it would have been in normal flow or 20% to the right.

## Absolute Positioning:
**position:absolute:** When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page. (They act like it is not there.) .The box offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) specify where the element should appear in relation to its containing element.
