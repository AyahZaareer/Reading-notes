## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
### The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.
### PUT: is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource. It is used to set an entity’s information completely. 
### PATCH is used when you want to apply a partial update to the resource.


## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server:

 1- Postman Mock Server
 
 2- Mockoon
 
 3- Mockable.io
 
 ## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
 
### ApiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes a default template which uses       handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page.
### Swagger Inspector: Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.
 
### Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

| Code	Status         |	Description                                                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200	OK	             | The request was successfully completed.                                         |
| 201	Created	        | A new resource was successfully created.                                        |
| 400	Bad Request     | The request was invalid.                                                        |
| 401	Unauthorized    |	The request did not include an authentication token or the authentication token |


## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST:
### SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer. SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern. SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.

### SOAP : is a protocol which was designed before REST and came into the picture. The main idea behind designing SOAP was to ensure that programs built on different platforms and programming languages could exchange data in an easy manner. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.

### REST : was designed specifically for working with components such as media components, files, or even objects on a particular hardware device. Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. A Restful service would use the normal HTTP verbs of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for working with the required components. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

   SOAP                                                 |                       REST                  | 
  |-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
  |   SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications. In SOAP, the WSDL file provides the client with the necessary information which can be used to understand what services the web service can offer.|REST use Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device. For example, if there is an object which represents the data of an employee hosted on a URL as http://demo.guru99 , the below are some of URI that can exist to access them http://demo.guru99.com/Employee   http://demo.guru99.com/Employee/1|
  |SOAP uses WSDL for communication between consumer and provider| REST just uses XML or JSON to send and receive data|
  | SOAP invokes services by calling RPC method | REST just simply calls services via URL path |
  | SOAP doesn't return human readable result.  |  REST result is readable with is just plain XML or JSON |
  
  
 ## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:
 
 ### Web Server: 
  A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP, the network protocol created to distribute web pages,[1] or its secure variant HTTPS.The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
  
 ### Express:
  Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.
  
 ### Routing:
  Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.These routing methods specify a callback function (sometimes called “handler functions”) called when the application receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method. In other words, the application “listens” for requests that match the specified route(s) and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback function.
  
 ### WRRC:
  The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).
  
  
  ## An introduction to NodeJS and Express:
  ### Node (or more formally Node.js)  :   is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries.
  
  #### Node has a number of benefits:
  - Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).
  - Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing both client-side and server-side code.
  - JavaScript is a relatively new programming language and benefits from improvements in language design when compared to other traditional web-server languages (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.) Many other new and popular languages compile/convert into JavaScript so you can also use TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, Scala, LiveScript, etc.
  - The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.
  - Node.js is portable. It is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, WebOS, and NonStop OS. Furthermore, it is well-supported by many web hosting providers, that often provide specific infrastructure and documentation for hosting Node sites.
  

### Introducing Express:
#### Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:
- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
- Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

#### While Express itself is fairly minimalist, developers have created compatible middleware packages to address almost any web development problem. There are libraries to work with cookies, sessions, user logins, URL parameters, POST data, security headers, and many more.

## What is NPM?
### NPM : is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

### Use npm to :
- Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
- Download standalone tools you can use right away.
- Run packages without downloading using npx.
- Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
- Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
- Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
- Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.


## What is TDD?
### Test-driven development : refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

### It can be succinctly described by the following set of rules:
- write a “single” unit test describing an aspect of the program
- run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
- write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
- “refactor” the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria.
- repeat, “accumulating” unit tests over time


## What is CI/CD?
### CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA "integration hell").

### What's the difference between CI and CD (and the other CD)?
- The "CI" in CI/CD always refers to continuous integration, which is an automation process for developers. Successful CI means new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository. It’s a solution to the problem of having too many branches of an app in development at once that might conflict with each other.
- The "CD" in CI/CD refers to continuous delivery and/or continuous deployment, which are related concepts that sometimes get used interchangeably. Both are about automating further stages of the pipeline, but they’re sometimes used separately to illustrate just how much automation is happening.
