## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
### The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.
### PUT: is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource. It is used to set an entity’s information completely. 
### PATCH is used when you want to apply a partial update to the resource.


## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server:

 1- Postman Mock Server
 
 2- Mockoon
 
 3- Mockable.io
 
 ## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
 ### ApiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page.
 ### Swagger Inspector: Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.
