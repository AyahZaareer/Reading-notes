## What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
### The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.
### PUT: is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource. It is used to set an entity’s information completely. 
### PATCH is used when you want to apply a partial update to the resource.


## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server:

 1- Postman Mock Server
 
 2- Mockoon
 
 3- Mockable.io
 
 ## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
 ### ApiDocjs: Inline Documentation for RESTful web APIs. It creates a documentation from API annotations in your source code. It includes a default template which uses handlebars, Bootstrap, RequireJS and jQuery for the output of the generated apidata.js and apiproject.js as a html-page.
 ### Swagger Inspector: Test and Document Your APIs With Ease. It is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool to simplify the validation of any API and generate its corresponding OpenAPI documentation.
 
 ### Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

| Code	Status         |	Description                                                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200	OK	             | The request was successfully completed.                                         |
| 201	Created	        | A new resource was successfully created.                                        |
| 400	Bad Request     | The request was invalid.                                                        |
| 401	Unauthorized    |	The request did not include an authentication token or the authentication token |


## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST:
### SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer. SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern. SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.

### SOAP : is a protocol which was designed before REST and came into the picture. The main idea behind designing SOAP was to ensure that programs built on different platforms and programming languages could exchange data in an easy manner. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.

### REST : was designed specifically for working with components such as media components, files, or even objects on a particular hardware device. Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. A Restful service would use the normal HTTP verbs of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for working with the required components. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

   SOAP                                                 |                       REST                  | 
  |-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
  |   SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications. In SOAP, the WSDL file provides the client with the necessary information which can be used to understand what services the web service can offer.|REST use Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device. For example, if there is an object which represents the data of an employee hosted on a URL as http://demo.guru99 , the below are some of URI that can exist to access them
http://demo.guru99.com/Employee

http://demo.guru99.com/Employee/1
