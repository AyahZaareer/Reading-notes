 ### < h1>  is used for main headings
 ### < h2>  is used for subheadings
 ### < h3>
 ### < h4>

 # Paragraphs:
 ## To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening < p> tag and closing < /p> tag. By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.

# Bold & Italic:
## < b> :By enclosing words in the tags < b> and < /b> we can make characters appear bold.
## < i> :By enclosing words in the tags < i> and < /i> we can make characters appear italic.


# Superscript & Subscript:
## < sup> :The < sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.
## < sub>: The < sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.

# White Space: 
## When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.

# Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules:
## < br /> :As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag < br />.

## < hr /> :To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the < hr /> tag.
